Clauses:

1.- For anyone using the code, the [url]dfhcommunity.com logo and website must be clearly displayed on the application/website where the code is used.

2.- If you decide to use a multichain visor feature for your app, it should remain free and open source.

3.- It is allowed to use the features of the multichain visor for other projects to be integrated and commercialized, the commercialization/publish to Play Store/App Store another apps store of the original concept is not allowed (because Play Store and App Store have different restrictions).

Why the conditions of this license?:

1.- We realized the app stores (Play Store /App Store) have requirements that are complex, fortunately we overcame these barriers and we have a working demo of the multichain visor v1.

2.- Greater user adoption of web3 is needed and pricing these features would limit that adoption. There are people who have low incomes and we are aware of them, that's why this initiative to always keep it free.

Because it is a public good and we encourage inclusive adoption for different people ðŸ˜‡ .
